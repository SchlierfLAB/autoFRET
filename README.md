For a quick setup make sure that ANACONDA is installed on your system. If not please visit https://anaconda.org and
install the free to use software. ANACONDA is not required in order to use the software but it will make life 
way more easy. You can run the autoinstall.py script which is currently under development. If the installaition
fails please follow the steps below.

Open the terminal and navigate to the project requirements directory. Afterwards run the following command (select
the file corresponding to your OS):

```bash

$ conda env create --name pyBatTreeENV --file enviroment.yml

```
you can also change the name of the env. by changing "pyBatTreeENV" in the command above.

Afterwards activate your environment with: 

```bash
$ conda activate <env name>
```

Now run the pyBat or pyTree file. For detailed information on the program refer to the git Wiki or the Usermanual in the Texts folder.
